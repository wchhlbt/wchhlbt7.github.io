      <description>&lt;!-- ### Overview

This paper systematically analyzes the transmission of an email and identiÔ¨Åes a series of new attacks capable of bypassing SPF, DKIM, DMARC and user-interface protections. We conduct a largescale experiment on 30 popular email services and 23 email clients, and Ô¨Ånd that all of them are vulnerable to certain types of new attacks.

[NoSpoofing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nospoofing/ehidaopjcnapdglbbbjgeoagpophfjnp). 
We designed a Chrome Extension called NoSpoofing. It is a UI notification scheme which can alert users that the emails they receive may be spoofing. --&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is my pleasure to have the opportunity to share our latest research work on email security live at NDSS Symposium 2024. Due to the Covid19, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to attend the international conference on site until this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also glad to meet many old friends and make new friends here. Thanks you for the hospitality of Xintong, it&amp;rsquo;s great to see old classmates on the other side of the pacific!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of interesting talks, nice beach and wonderful sunset. It was a great experience~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you NDSS~ See you San DiegoüèùÔ∏è Hope to see you again~&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an email authentication protocol to protect the integrity of email contents. It has been proposed and standardized for over a decade and adopted by Yahoo!, Google, and other leading email service providers. However, little has been done to understand the adoption rate and potential security issues of DKIM due to the challenges of measuring DKIM deployment at scale. &lt;br&gt; In this paper, we provide a large-scale and longitudinal measurement study on how well DKIM is deployed and managed. Our study was made possible by a broad collection of datasets, including 9.5 million DKIM records from passive DNS datasets over five years and 460 million DKIM signatures from real-world email headers. Moreover, we conduct an active measurement on Alexa Top 1 million domains. Our measurement results show that 28.1% of Alexa Top 1 million domains have enabled DKIM, of which 2.9% are misconfigured. We demonstrate that the issues of DKIM key management and DKIM signatures are prevalent in the real world, even for well-known email providers (e.g., Gmail and Mail.ru). We recommend the security community should pay more attention to the systemic problems of DKIM deployment and mitigate these issues from the perspective of protocol design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also proposed an online detection tool for email administrator, called &amp;ldquo;Nospoofing&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 2021 West Lake Cybersecurity Conference, I presented an email security evaluation tool. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wchhlbt/EmailSpoofingTestTool&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ESpoofing&lt;/a&gt; to the audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- In the 2021 West Lake Cybersecurity Conference, I presented the IPv6 network scanner [XMap](https://idealeer.github.io/project/xmap/) to the audiences. --&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NoSpoofing is a UI notification scheme which can alert users that the emails they receive may be spoofing..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email UI rendering is a significant part that affects the users‚Äô perception of an email‚Äôs authenticity. However, most of the web mails and email clients we tested do not display SPF, DKIM, or DMARC authentication results explicitly. Thus, it is difficult for ordinary users to fully understand the details of email authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective defense method is to provide a user-friendly UI notification, which alerts users that the emails they receive may be spoofing. This extension is such an UI notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage: Users can click the icon of the extension when reading an email. Then the web UI will show whether the email is safe or not. If users want to know the details of this email, they can click the notification message.&lt;/p&gt;
