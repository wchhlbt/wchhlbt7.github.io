abstract = {5G messaging services, based on Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) Rich Communication Service (RCS) and 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), have been deployed globally by more than 90 mobile operators serving over 421 million monthly active users via 1.2 billion devices. Despite the widespread use, security research of 5G messaging remains sparse. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis and measurement of 5G messaging services, assisted by a semi-automated testing tool we developed. We considered both carrier-side deployment and phone-side software implementations by testing against three large operators, each with hundreds of millions of subscribers, and six popular 5G messaging-enabled devices. We uncovered 4 categories of vulnerabilities, allowing for a wide range of attacks, including Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, zero-click remote information leakage, phone storage exhaustion and mobile data consumption, and Denial-of-Services (DoS) attacks. Our study underscores the need for further security enhancements in security specifications, implementation, and deployment of 5G messaging services.},
